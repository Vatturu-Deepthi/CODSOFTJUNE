TASK-1
The password generator project involves creating a Python application that generates strong and random passwords. Users input the desired password length and complexity. The program then combines random characters to create a password of the specified length. Finally, the generated password is displayed on the screen for the user to see. This tool enhances security by producing robust passwords tailored to user preferences.

TASK-2
Create a user-friendly game where the user selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer responds with a random choice. Determine the winner based on the game logic: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. Display the choices and the result, indicating whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie. Optionally, track scores for multiple rounds and offer the option to play again. Design a clear interface with instructions and feedback.
